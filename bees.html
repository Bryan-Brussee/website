    <h2>Bloomington's Bees</h2>
    <hr>


<p>Bloomington is enjoying one of the warmest falls in history. But while the sun is shining brighter than ever, the bees aren’t buzzing like they used to.
</p>
<p>Beekeepers in Indiana lost on average 13% of their total honey bee colonies per season in 2015, according to a National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) report released May 12. Compared with the rest of the country, Indiana colony loss was below the national average of 15% hive loss per season, the NASS report found.
      </p>      
<p>That’s little consolation for local beekeepers, though. They’ve struggled all year to keep their hives alive. 
  </p>  
<p>Sydney Ziegler, media coordinator for Indiana University’s beekeeping club, said keeping hives through the winter was the club’s biggest challenge last year. According to the NASS report, the season killed twice as many bees as any other.
</p>
<p>Ziegler and the rest of IU’s beekeeping club had to take special precautions just to see their hives through the early months of the year. Making sure colonies had enough food was paramount, Ziegler said.
</p>
<p>“We wean [the bees] onto sugar water so that they’re building more nectar and honey in their colony so that they can survive through the winter,” she said. “They have to survive on those resources, and if they don’t, then they are going to die.”
</p>
<p>In the two years since the beekeeping club’s founding, not a single colony has lasted the winter, Ziegler said.
</p>
<p>Cold weather wasn’t the only factor contributing to honey bee loss. Last year 325,010 colonies succumbed to colony collapse disorder, a phenomenon characterized by the mass disappearance of a colony’s worker bee population. That’s over 10% of total US bee colonies, according to the NASS report.
</p>
<p>While no one knows the exact reason why colony collapse disorder occurs, it’s a complex problem believed to have multiple causes, said Ziegler.
</p>
<p>“Colony collapse disorder is not any one thing that you know is happening,” she said. "It’s just your colony didn’t make it.”
</p>
<p>Over the last decade, colony collapse disorder has become a major concern for beekeepers like George Hegeman, a local expert with over forty years of consulting experience. 
  </p>  
<p>He’s helped establish colonies at downtown’s WonderLab science museum, the local community orchard and IU’s Hilltop Gardens. Often, he’s been called upon to help with prepare those colonies for stressors that weren’t around in the 1970s.
</p>
<p>“You have to worry about mites, colony collapse disorder and you have to learn how to deal with these,” he said. “I would say in the last ten years, it’s gotten noticeably harder to keep bees.” 
</p>
<p>Though not as devastating to hives as colony collapse disorder, mites and other parasites were the most common stressors for bee colonies.
</p>
<p> According to the NASS report, almost one in five Indiana colonies suffered pests in the first half of last year. While that proportion fell to one in seven bee colonies after April, it remained a nuisance that beekeepers had to fight all year long.
</p>
<p>Protecting colonies against mites is a dedicated effort. Beekeepers need to medicate their hives about once every six weeks, Hegeman said, and because it takes such dedication, farmers have had a tough time keeping colonies. 
</p>
<p>“It used to be that almost every farmstead with a tree or two or any kind of garden had a beehive around back of the barn,” he said. “It tends to be more complicated these days, because there are a number of diseases and problems that beset bees that weren’t around many years ago.”
</p>
<p>While bee populations are still suffering this year, there’s evidence to believe 2016 will be kinder to bees. Last winter, Indiana beekeepers only lost 12% of their colonies, as opposed to the 22% lost that same month in 2015.
</p>
<p>According to Hegeman, bees help produce two out of every three bites of food Americans take.
</p>
<p>Ziegler said that while bees pollinate food crops, they also produce key ingredients used in a variety of other products.
</p>
<p>“We use so much of the bees’ resources for our own benefit, like beeswax for candles or ChapStick,” she said. “Not only do they provide us with our food resources, but there are so many things that we don’t know that they provide for us.”
</p>
<p>Hegeman said that concerned citizens can take small precautions to make Bloomington a better place for bees. 
</p>
<p>“Let some weeds grow,” he said. “Fence rows used to be useful food sources all summer for pollinating insects. But not anymore. Now it’s nice clean fields from fence row to fence row, and that’s not good for the bees.”
